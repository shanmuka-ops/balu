        <p>Shri Narendra Modi was sworn-in as India's Prime Minister for the third time on 9th June 2024, following
            another
            decisive victory in the 2024 Parliamentary elections. This victory marked the third consecutive term for
            Shri
            Modi, further solidifying his leadership.</p>
        <p>The 2024 elections saw a remarkable voter turnout, with a significant portion of the electorate showing
            continued
            confidence in Shri Modi’s leadership and vision for the country. His campaign focused on a blend of economic
            development, national security, and social welfare programs, which resonated widely with the populace.</p>
        <p>Shri Modi's third term is expected to build on the foundations laid during his previous tenures, with a
            renewed
            emphasis on technological innovation, infrastructure development, and international diplomacy, further
            positioning India as a global powerhouse. The unprecedented third term underscores Shri Modi's enduring
            appeal
            and the trust placed in him by millions of Indians to lead the nation towards greater prosperity and
            stability.
        </p>
        <p>inspired by the motto of 'SabkaSaath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas', Shri Modi has ushered in a paradigm shift
            in
            governance that has led to inclusive, development-oriented and corruption-free governance. The Prime
            Minister
            has worked with speed and scale to realise the aim of Antyodaya, or ensuring last-mile delivery of schemes
            and
            services.</p>

        <p>Agriculture is a sector that is very close to Shri Narendra Modi. During the interim budget of 2019, the
            Government announced a monetary incentive for farmers called the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi. In almost three
            weeks, on
            24th February 2019, the scheme was launched and instalments have been paid regularly since then. During the
            first
            Cabinet Meeting of PM Modi’s second term, it was decided to extend the PM Kisan benefits to all farmers,
            removing
            the 5 acre limit that was present earlier. As of June 2024, Shri Modi released the 17thinstalment of the
            PM-KISAN
            scheme at Varanasi in which more than 9.2 crore farmers received the benefits amounting to over Rs.20,000
            crore.</p>
        <p>Shri Modi has also focused path-breaking initiatives for agriculture ranging from Soil Health Cards, E-NAM
            for
            better markets and a renewed focus on irrigation. On 30th May 2019, PM Modi fulfilled a major promise by
            creating a new Jal Shakti Ministry to cater to all aspects relating to water resources.</p>
        <p>On 2nd October 2014, Mahatma Gandhi’s Birth Anniversary, the PM launched ‘Swachh Bharat Mission’ a mass
            movement
            for cleanliness across the nation. The scale and impact of the movement is historic. Today, sanitation
            coverage
            has risen from 38% in 2014 to 100% in 2019. All states and Union Territories have been declared open
            defecation
            free (ODF). Substantive measures been taken for a clean Ganga.</p>
        <p>The World Health Organisation has appreciated the Swachh Bharat Mission and has opined that it would save
            three
            lakh lives.</p>
